# Project-_Flashcards-_Qualified-Shaun_McRae-Solution

## Overview

### Purpose
A project to create a React based flashcard app. 

### Description and Features
Intended to be able to create multiple flashcard decks filled with the individual flashcards.
- Home page displays all the user's decks along with a button to create more.    
	- Each deck will have it's title and description shown along with buttons to view, edit, study, or delete them.  
- Viewing an individual deck will have the same as above with a list of cards with their front and back and buttons to add, edit, or delete the cards.
- Study will first show the front of a card with a button to flip the card. Once flipped the viewer can flip it back or go to the next card. At the end the user will be given a notification to return to the start of the deck or the home page.
- Editing a deck will display the deck's current title and description to be edited; editing a card will display the card's current front and back to be edited.
	- Creating a new deck or card will show the same as above, except blank.
- Breadcrumb navbar for easy navigation.
- Bad routes display: "Not Found"
- Deck's will need at least 3 cards to be able to study.
  - Add card button when at study view of a deck with <3 cards and an error message

## Improvements and future
- No login or restrictions on who can access or edit the decks
- No dedicated server or ability to designate one, saved locally
- Could use better styling
- Not deployed
